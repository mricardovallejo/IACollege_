Explaining Black Box Models and Datasets
-------------------------------------------
SHAP  - SHapley Additive exPlanations is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.
tensorflow's lucid  - Lucid is a collection of infrastructure and tools for research in neural network interpretability.
DeepVis Toolbox  - This is the code required to run the Deep Visualization Toolbox, as well as to generate the neuron-by-neuron visualizations using regularized optimization. 
ELI5  - "Explain Like I'm 5" is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions.

Model and Data Versioning
--------------------------

Data Version Control (DVC)  - A git fork that allows for version management of models.
Sacred  - Tool to help you configure, organize, log and reproduce machine learning experiments.
TRAINS  - Auto-Magical Experiment Manager & Version Control for AI.

Model Training Orchestration
----------------------------
Kubeflow  - A cloud native platform for machine learning based on Google’s internal machine learning pipelines.
Skaffold  - Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications. You can iterate on your application source code locally then deploy to local or remote Kubernetes clusters.
CML  - Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is an open-source library for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) in machine learning projects.
NVIDIA TensorRT  - TensorRT is a C++ library for high performance inference on NVIDIA GPUs and deep learning accelerators.

Model Serving and Monitoring
-----------------------------
Tensorflow Serving  - High-performant framework to serve Tensorflow models via grpc protocol able to handle 100k requests per second per core
Jina  - Cloud native search framework that supports to use deep learning/state of the art AI models for search.
Seldon Core  - Open source platform for deploying and monitoring machine learning models in kubernetes - (Video)

Feature Engineering Automation
---------------------------------

TPOT  - Automation of sklearn pipeline creation (including feature selection, pre-processor, etc)
tsfresh  - Automatic extraction of relevant features from time series
auto-sklearn  - Framework to automate algorithm and hyperparameter tuning for sklearn
AutoGluon  - Automated feature, model, and hyperparameter selection for tabular, image, and text data on top of popular machine learning libraries (Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, PyTorch, MXNet)
AutoML-GS  - Automatic feature and model search with code generation in Python, on top of common data science libraries (tensorflow, sklearn, etc)

Commercial Platforms
------------------
Amazon SageMaker - End-to-end machine learning development and deployment interface where you are able to build notebooks that use EC2 instances as backend, and then can host models exposed on an API


Kubeflow - https://www.bmc.com/blogs/machine-learning-containers/
---------
Kubeflow is a tool launched in 2018 by Google to help orchestrate the ML modelling process. Where Architects have Revit, ML engineers have Kubeflow. 
Kubeflow allows ML engineers to see just where their models are at in their training process, in terms of sequence, 
and also exposes the TensorFlow Tensorboard tool to show how well the model is performing. So Kubeflow abides by the Redhat High Observability Principle (HOP).

Kubeflow is a great tool, so I’ll summarize the key benefits:

Great documentation
Multi-cloud framework
Monitoring tools
Workflow management
Model deployment

Kubeflow supports Jupyter Notebook integration. It will use the kf-fairing library for both training directly from the notebook or deploying a model from the notebook. 
Kubeflow includes services to spawn and manage Jupyter notebooks, 
and even custom resources to containerize a Jupyter notebook so it is prepped to run on the Kubernetes infrastructure.

GitHub Actions
---------------
Then, to make this seamlessly integrate with your CI/CD infrastructure and GitHub, GitHub launched GitHub Actions in 2019 to help automate the CI/CD process.
